# Flappy Bird Game

This project is a Flappy Bird–style arcade game where the player controls a bird and navigates through moving pipes by pressing the spacebar to jump. The goal is to survive as long as possible while earning points by successfully passing through pipes.

The player starts with two lives. Colliding with a pipe removes one life, while hitting the floor or ceiling immediately ends the game. Each pipe passed increases the score by one, and the game keeps track of the highest score achieved.

During gameplay, power-ups can appear that temporarily change how the game plays, including invincibility against pipes, slower-moving pipes, and double points for a limited time.

The game includes three playable birds, each with different physics and abilities. One bird has a stronger jump, another has increased gravity with a short glide ability, and the third is heavier but can dash forward.

This project focuses on core game programming concepts such as input handling, collision detection, game states, scoring, and basic physics.
